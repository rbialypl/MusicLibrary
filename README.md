# MusicLibrary
Music library and metadata tracker.


I enjoy listening to music while I work, surf the web or while playing games. As a result I felt like taking on a small project and designing a music library of my own. It originally started due to many of my music files missing meta-data such as artist, year, genre, among many others. Currently the program is able to extract the meta-data details and print them to the screen. Additional information about this project will be posted as more is developed.
